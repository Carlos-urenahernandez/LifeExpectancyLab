  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Data Journalism!</h1>
  <div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;">

  This project seeks to create an infographic-like website with data on housing development
   applications submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) from 2000 to 2021. 
   The data is sourced from the 
   <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Job-Application-Filings/ic3t-wcy2/about_data">NYC Open Data Portal</a>.
  Data is visualized using SVGs to create a map of New York City boroughs, with each borough's color saturation representing the number of applications submitted in that year. 
  and an overall line graph showing the total number of applications submitted each year. The data includes applications that include permits for new buildings, alterations, and demolitions. This should indicate how much development is happening per borough per year

      After showing my prototypes to my classmates, the comment I recieved the most was that the 
      graph of the boroughs was hard to understand because they had to constantly refer back to the legend. 
      I was also told that the line graph was hard to read because of the many different colors and lines and that the 
      labels on the lines were not very clear further adding to the confusion.

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Takeaways</h3>
  <ul style="list-style: disc; display: table; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;">
  <li>Line graph is kind of confusing with many different colors across many vastly different lines.</li>
  <li>Patterns are not easy to understand in Borough graph.</li>
  <li>Legend instead of labels on line.</li> 
</ul>
