            The data for all boroughs for all years is shown in the line graph on the left. 
            Each line represents a borough, and the line's color indicates which borough it is using the legend.
            Manhattan had a substantially higher number of applications than every other borough between 2008 and 2017 
            but has been declining since 2013. The Bronx has had the total lowest number of applications of any borough and has had
            a similar number of applications to Staten Island
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <li>Manhattan has had the greatest number of applications and therefore more development than any other borough</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 10px;">The Bronx has had the fewest number of applications and therefore less development than any other borough</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 10px;">The 2008 recession did not seem to substantially affect housing development in NYC</li>
